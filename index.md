# Neha Naladala's First CS193 Homework 

- Love the upperclassmen's dedication towards this course.
- Love that I'm learning the gaps in my major through this course. I wouldn't have known how to navigate GitHub otherwise.
- Love that it's an environment where you don't have to be embarassed that you don't know something.
